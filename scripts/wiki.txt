'''BlueSeer ERP''' is a Free [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Enterprise
resource planning|ERP]] system.  It was developed primarily for the
manufacturing community, but it has many specific utilities that are useful in
other markets such as transportation, distribution, warehouse management systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thesmbguide.com/free-manufacturing-software|title=The Small Manufacturing Business Guide|website=www.smbguide.com|accessdate= 11 July 2019}}</ref>  
The accounting aspects of the software also make it particularly useful for
personal finance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goodfirms-publishes-best-free-open-143000000.html|title=GoodFirms Publish Best Free Open|website=finance.yahoo.com|accessdate=8 July 2019}} </ref>  
The development of BlueSeer started in 2005
and continues with the latest version 4.2 released on June 26th 2019.</br>
The core objective in the development of BlueSeer has always been to
provide the manufacturing community with an ERP system that would be as generic as possible to fit a wide variety of
functional needs right out of the box while at the same time providing an
affordable avenue for customization and a simplified development framework to
add/extend new business logic.
BlueSeer is currently ranked in the top 5 listings of free ERP solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://erpinnews.com/top-15-free-and-open-source-erp-solutions|title=Top 15 Free ERP Solutions|website=erpinnews.com|accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref>                 

== Functionality ==
BlueSeer provides a set of generic functional modules that are universally
found in many different manufacturing environments.   The modules are designed
to be a widely usable as possible and therefore generic in scope.   
BlueSeer offers the following functionality:
* Double Entry General Ledger
* Cost Accounting
* Accounts Receivable Processing and Aging
* Accounts Payable Processing and Aging
* PayRoll
* Inventory Control
* Job Tracking
* Lot Traceability
* Order Management
* Service Order and Quoting Management
* Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
* UCC Label Generation
* Materials Resource Planning (MRP)
* Human Resources (HR)

== Technology ==
BlueSeer ERP is written entirely in [[Java]].  BlueSeer is a non-web based
[[graphical user interface]] desktop application that relies heavily on the Java Swing [[Swing (Java)]] widget
toolkit/library.  The options for back-end database depends on the usage.
For single client deployment, The relational database [[SQLite]] is used for
it's simplicity, deployment ease, and server-less design.  For multi-client
deployment scenarios, the open-source relational database [[MySQL]] is used as the
back-end database server.  MySQL was chosen for it's popularity and excellent
performance reviews<ref>[http://review.techworld.com/applications/346/mysql-50-open-source-database/ Review of MySQL Server 5.0], Techworld.com, November 2005</ref>.
</br>
BlueSeer is a menu-driven application.  It's "molecular composition" is essentially a collection of Java Swing
JPanel widgets.  Each Business Function, i.e. Order Entry, Item Master
Maintenance is a stand-alone JPanel (except for shared database
calls between functional modules).  </br>
BlueSeer's unique design loads the JPanel
at runtime using [[Reflection (computer programming)]] to 'inject' the JPanel into the JFrame at user
demand (assuming the user has permissions to execute the Menu/JPanel).  The
JPanel class name is stored in the database and associated
with a menu option which in turn is associated with user permissions.  This
allows for ease of customization and extension.  Adding additional
functionality
simply becomes a matter of creating a new JPanel that encapcuslates the new
business logic (and relevant widgets), associating the new class with a menu option, and inserting
the class/menu/permission records into the database with the built-in
management menu.  </br>
The ease of adding new JPanel classes
makes BlueSeer an attractive
Desktop Application Framework to quickly deploy new desktop application
functionality given the menu/class managment and
permissions functionality that's built into the BlueSeer framework.
