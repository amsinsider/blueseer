How to install a free ERP for your business


Nearly all business orginazations have some form of software solution(s) to
support their day-to-day operational activities.  These solutions are
typically lumped into a namespace called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).
Theres is a wide spectrum of solutions to choose from and the list continues
to grow and shows no signs of slowing.  The linux OS is largely employed as
back-end database / application servers to support a wide range of ERP
packages offered.   However, there are very few incidents where the linux
platform is used as the client side.  I provide below an example of how to
install and use an ERP that is native to the linux desktop as a standalone
desktop application.   
     BlueSeer is a simple generic ERP application that can be installed as
either a standalone application or as a multi-client applicatoin.  The
applicatoin is written entirely in Java, and can be run on any Linux distro
that has the JVM installed.   BlueSeer comes with a debian package file .deb.
I am going to show below how to install BlueSeer on a Linux Mint 19 OS using
the dpkg installer for debian based .deb files.
     Before we start, make sure you have the JVM installed on your OS.  open a
shell prompt and type:

/home/user1$ java -version

If java is installed you will see the specific version available on your distro.  After you have
confirmed the existence of the JVM, download the .deb package from BlueSeer's
source repository.
