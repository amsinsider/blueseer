WINDOWS INSTALL (SQLITE):
The single user version comes with a built-in database engine (sqlite) that does not require a database installation step.  So this is the easiest install. 

You MUST have the java JRE pre-installed.   Java 8 through 11 should suffice.

Now...with all that said...here's how to install the sqlite Version.

Install Steps:
1. Download blueseer.sqlite.win.exe to your local PC 
2. Run the package installer blueseer.sqlite.win.exe (you may need admin rights)
3. When finished, you should have a shortcut on your desktop to launch the blueseer application.

NOTE 1:    Login and Password are both 'admin' and 'admin'.
NOTE 2:  you will probably want to set your screen resolution to something higher than "1240 x 768" for best results.

LINUX INSTALL:
You MUST have the java JRE pre-installed.   Java 8 through 11 should suffice.
You MUST ALSO have mysql installed...mysql 5.5 or higher should suffice.
You MUST provide the mysql admin password when requested at the prompt during
the install.

Now...with all that said...here's how to install the Linux/MySQL Version of
BlueSeer.

Install Steps:
1. Download blueseer.mysql.linux.zip to your local PC 
2. Go to command line and 'unzip' the zip file into any directory...something
similiar to 'unzip blueseer.mysql.linux.zip' ...if you have unzip installed.
3. run "chmod 777 mysql_install.sh" ...to change the install file to
executable.
4. run "./mysql_install.sh"  ...and type in the required info when requested.
5. It's installed.  You can launch by typing the following at shell prompt :
   "java -cp ".:dist/*" bsmf.MainFrame"   ...make sure you're in the blueseer
   directory.

NOTE 1:    Login and Password are both 'admin' and 'admin'.
NOTE 2:  you will probably want to set your screen resolution to something higher than "1240 x 768" for best results.
