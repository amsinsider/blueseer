The single user version comes with a built-in database engine (sqlite) that does not require a database installation step.  So this is the easiest install. 

You MUST have the java JRE pre-installed.   Java 8 through 11 should suffice.

Now...with all that said...here's how to install the sqlite Version.

Install Steps:
1. Download blueseer.sqlite.win.zip to your local PC 
2. Extract installer from zip file 
3. Run the package installer blueseer.sqlite.win.exe (you may need admin rights)
4. When finished, you should have a shortcut on your desktop to launch the blueseer application.

NOTE 1:    Login and Password are both 'admin' and 'admin'.
NOTE 2:  you will probably want to set your screen resolution to something higher than "1240 x 768" for best results.
