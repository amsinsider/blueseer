The single user version comes with a built-in database engine (sqlite) that does not require a database installation step.  So this is the easiest install. 

You MUST have the java JRE pre-installed.   Java 8 through 11 should suffice.

Now...with all that said...here's how to install the sqlite Version.

Install Steps:
1. Download blueseer.install.sqlite.win.zip to your local PC 
2. Create the following directory..."C:\blueseer"
3. Extract all contents of zip file "INTO" the newly created "blueseer" directory. 
4. Open the c:\blueseer directory with its contents and double click the
file "sqlite_install.bat".  This will bring up a cmd screen displaying some actions that will be executed.
Once the script is finished the cmd screen will disappear and the installation is complete....you're done  :)

You can now double click on the 'login.bat' file in the blueseer directory, and the application should launch.  


NOTE 1:    Login and Password are both 'admin' and 'admin'.
NOTE 2:  you will probably want to set your screen resolution to something higher than "1240 x 768" for best results.
